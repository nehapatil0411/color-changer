Color Changer
This project is a Color Changer web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the project was to create an interactive and dynamic user experience where users can easily change the background color of the webpage in real time. This project demonstrates the fundamental use of web technologies to build an engaging and functional tool.

Technologies Used:
-> HTML: Used to create the basic structure of the webpage, including the color picker and buttons.

-> CSS: Styled the page, including the layout, button appearance, and transitions for smooth color changes.

-> JavaScript: Implemented the logic for dynamically changing the background color in response to user input.

How It Works:
-> The HTML structure defines a basic layout with a color picker and buttons.

-> CSS is used to style the page and ensure it is visually appealing and responsive.

-> JavaScript handles the logic for detecting color selection and applying it to the page's background. When a user selects a color, the JavaScript code captures the event and updates the page's background accordingly.

This project highlights how you can combine these three technologies to create a small but interactive web tool. It can serve as a foundation for more complex projects or be used as a simple customization tool on websites.
